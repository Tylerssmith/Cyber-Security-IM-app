Assignment: Create a complete list of functional and non-functional requirements and a set of Use-Cases for the Secure Asynchronous Messaging System as discussed in class. From these, create a top-level design.

Description of system from 'client':
    I want the system so that conversations between senior partners cannot be accessed by jr partners.
    Jr partners are tech savvy and want to access senior level conversations.
    I want full partners and jr partners to be able to talk to each other.
    Make it so that anything jr partners say, senior partners can see those conversations.
    The system has to be able to securely archive conversations for later;
    You can have the credentials for logging in be chosen by each employee but they have to managed by an administrator in case an employee forgets the information or termination of an employee..
    Interface should look something like phone messaging, just something people would be used to. 
    It doesnâ€™t matter which platform you use, it can be mobile, web, or desktop. Which ever is easiest and most secure.
    It should be more like chat rooms than single conversations though.
    The admin should be able to periodically look at rooms and decide if they should be archived. Also, they should be able to search through archived sessions and can bring them back.
    The admin again, needs to be able to manage credentials and be able to create and remove users for the employees.
    So I guess there would be 3 types of users: Sr partners, jr partners, and admins. The admins should probably be Sr partners because they would have access to all the conversations.
    Later the company might want to add a way for customers to speak with our employees, so it needs to be extensible and not to difficult to add that functionality.
    Just to make sure it is clear, SECURITY IS PRIMARY CONCERN. Some of these conversations could have very negative consequences if they were in the wrong hands.
